### Software That Does Stuff

One of the reasons I am drawn to baremetal programming is because it's usually code that *does something*. It is an end node of a tree of integrations. It is a `while` loop that will perform a task so long as true is true. So much of the "high level" software I've written is integration work getting THIS framework to work with THAT vendor code. It's necessary, but it's software that is outshined by a blinking LED.

Funny to think that the bulk of any given codebase is likely to be drab foddercode, with a few bright sprigs of FUNCTIONALITY bursting forth from the substrate. What a joy it is to write functionality.
