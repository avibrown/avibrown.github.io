### chown /home

Since I left home at 17 I have rented all of my various domiciles. 13 years of renting from 𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐋𝐎𝐑𝐃𝐒.

Right now my wife and I have a good 𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐋𝐎𝐑𝐃. If something breaks, we call her, she sends her guy, he sends her the bill and it's over and done with. I don't take that for granted. Recently though I spoke to a childhood friend who told me about his experiences as a new homeowner in Texas. For the first time in his life he finds himself puttering about on his own property, fixing things up, making sure everything's infrastructurally sound. 

This simple image made me envious. I think my envy stems from the same angst that George Hotz expressed in one of his streams:

> Do you really own anything anymore? When you buy a PlayStation from Sony do you own that PlayStation? When you buy a car from Honda do you own that car? Or are they just renting it to you? Are they renting everything to you?

To be clear, I think this has much less to do with the merits of taking out a mortgage and more to do with what it means to be a *habitual renter*, and not just of living space.

You know another way to say "to rent out"? "To let". Like -
###### "ROOM FOR LET"

Open your Windows computer. How much of the functionality therein are 𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐘 *letting* you use, and how much do you feel you actually have *ownership* of? I'm not making a qualitative point (yet), but it's worth pondering. How much of the functionality is subscription-based or contingent on the creators' decision to continue to offer the service?

𝐌𝐈𝐂𝐑𝐎𝐒𝐎𝐅𝐓 *lets* us use Windows (unless there's an update).

𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐋𝐎𝐑𝐃𝐒 *let* us live in their apartments.

Maybe I use Linux for the same reason I'm saving up for a house.
