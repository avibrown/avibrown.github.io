What is it about the C Standard Library that makes me want to escape to a cabin in the woods with nothing but an old Thinkpad and the `man` pages? Why does `malloc()` fill me with the same primordial yearning as running my hand over a piece of lumber? Programming headlessly on a Debian box feels more akin to running a tablesaw than to scrolling TikTok (on a phone running Linux).
