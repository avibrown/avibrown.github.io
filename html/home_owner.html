    ### chown /home
    
    Since I left home at 17 I have rented all of my various domiciles. 13 years of renting from 𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐋𝐎𝐑𝐃𝐒.
    
    Right now my wife and I have a good 𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐋𝐎𝐑𝐃. If something breaks, we call her, she sends her guy, he sends her the bill and it&#39;s over and done with. I don&#39;t take that for granted. Recently though I spoke to a childhood friend who told me about his experiences as a new homeowner in Texas. For the first time in his life he finds himself puttering about on his own property, fixing things up, making sure everything&#39;s infrastructurally sound. 
    
    This simple image made me envious. I think my envy stems from the same angst that George Hotz expressed in one of his streams:
    
    &gt; Do you really own anything anymore? When you buy a PlayStation from Sony do you own that PlayStation? When you buy a car from Honda do you own that car? Or are they just renting it to you? Are they renting everything to you?
    
    To be clear, I think this has much less to do with the merits of taking out a mortgage and more to do with what it means to be a <em>habitual renter</em>, and not just of living space.
    
    You know another way to say &quot;to rent out&quot;? &quot;To let&quot;. Like -
    ###### &quot;ROOM FOR LET&quot;
    
    Open your Windows computer. How much of the functionality therein are 𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐘 <em>letting</em> you use, and how much do you feel you actually have <em>ownership</em> of? I&#39;m not making a qualitative point (yet), but it&#39;s worth pondering. How much of the functionality is subscription-based or contingent on the creators&#39; decision to continue to offer the service?
    
    𝐌𝐈𝐂𝐑𝐎𝐒𝐎𝐅𝐓 <em>lets</em> us use Windows (unless there&#39;s an update).
    
    𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐋𝐎𝐑𝐃𝐒 <em>let</em> us live in their apartments.
    
    Maybe I use Linux for the same reason I&#39;m saving up for a house.
