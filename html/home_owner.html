        <h1>chown /home</h1>
<p>Since I left home at 17 I have rented all of my various domiciles. 13 years of renting from 𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐋𝐎𝐑𝐃𝐒.</p>
<p>Right now my wife and I have a good 𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐋𝐎𝐑𝐃. If something breaks, we call her, she sends her guy, he sends her the bill and it's over and done with. I don't take that for granted. Recently though I spoke to a childhood friend who told me about his experiences as a new homeowner in Texas. For the first time in his life he finds himself puttering about on his own property, fixing things up, making sure everything's infrastructurally sound. </p>
<p>This simple image made me envious. I think my envy stems from the same angst that George Hotz expressed in one of his streams:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Do you really own anything anymore? When you buy a PlayStation from Sony do you own that PlayStation? When you buy a car from Honda do you own that car? Or are they just renting it to you? Are they renting everything to you?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To be clear, I think this has much less to do with the merits of taking out a mortgage and more to do with what it means to be a <em>habitual renter</em>, and not just of living space.</p>
<p>You know another way to say "to rent out"? "To let". Like -</p>
<h3>"ROOM FOR LET"</h3>
<p>Open your Windows computer. How much of the functionality therein are 𝐓𝐇𝐄𝐘 <em>letting</em> you use, and how much do you feel you actually have <em>ownership</em> of? I'm not making a qualitative point (yet), but it's worth pondering. How much of the functionality is subscription-based or contingent on the creators' decision to continue to offer the service?</p>
<p>𝐌𝐈𝐂𝐑𝐎𝐒𝐎𝐅𝐓 <em>lets</em> us use Windows (unless there's an update).</p>
<p>𝐋𝐀𝐍𝐃𝐋𝐎𝐑𝐃𝐒 <em>let</em> us live in their apartments.</p>
<p>Maybe I use Linux for the same reason I'm saving up for a house.</p>
